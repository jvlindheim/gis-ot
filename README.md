# GIS-OT
Examples for regularized OT with affine constraints using the algorithm called generalized iterative scaling (GIS) or simultaneous algebraic multiplicative reconstruction technique (SMART):
+ Minimizing the regularized OT divergence to a given measure, subject to moment constraints
+ Martingale OT
+ Barycentric weak OT
